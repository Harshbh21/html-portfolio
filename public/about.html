<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm Harsh, a second-year engineering student at Thadomal Shahani Engineering College with a growing passion for coding and web development.

I recently started my coding journey â€” and honestly, Iâ€™m loving every bit of it. The beginning wasnâ€™t smooth (hello bugs and errors ðŸ˜…), but every challenge helped me learn something new and become more confident in my skills. From basic HTML to building small projects, Iâ€™ve been enjoying the process of turning ideas into actual websites.

Alongside web development, Iâ€™m also practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to strengthen my problem-solving skills and get ready for future tech roles.

But itâ€™s not all code! Outside the screen, I love to travel, play chess, and enjoy a good game of cricket. Whether it's solving a tough DSA problem or hitting a six on the field, Iâ€™m all about learning, improving, and having fun along the way.

This is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m excited to see where this journey takes me!
